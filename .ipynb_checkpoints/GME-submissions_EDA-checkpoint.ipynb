       "It's amazing how this community and social.media in general has pushed things like Gamestop and AMC but I'm definitely puzzled how investors on here latch on to these companies after they make their massive runs. No matter what the technicals say, no matter how much they ascended they just can't let go and move on to another candidate that has more potential. I'm a seasoned investor and I highly suggest you look at FUBO. Technically it has formed a base and looks like it wants to run higher and from what I gather 20% of the float is shorted. Beyond that the company is growing faster than any other streaming service on the planet and that's no pumping. It has so many catysts fundamentally with the subscriber growth, ad growth and sports book potential which should be rolled out soon. Here is a fact.....they are the only sports centric streaming service and they will be the only ones that will both be the streaming service and sports book. We all know that betting is exploding as state by state surrenders and allows gambling and in the end bettors will want to watch the game and bet on that game on that streaming service. That is the ideal setup and neither Fanduel or Draftkings can do that. They also will own all of the analytics and user data of their subscribers to be able to tailor their marketing. The other betting sites which are doing partnerships with content providers won't own that data and the content providers won't share that data with the betting sites. They are very reluctant to share that data so that's another competitive advantage for Fubo. I think Fubo could offer reduced fees or free fees for bettors who do so much wagering and what bettor wouldn't want to have a free service to do their betting on? I can tell you that the betting sites that are forced to sign with content providers will definitely be paying a fee for that partnership or they will be forced to share their betting profits with that provider. Fubo will in essence have that vertical.integration that others just won't have. It's such a juicy company long term and at the same time has that squeeze potential. Have no.idea why GME or AMC lovers continue to be long there when they already have had runs that far outweigh what they are worth. Move on to something else folks......FUBO is a great candidate.    1   \n",

       "Would you be willing to sleep if you had millions of $ shorted on a company that is about to beat the current record for a short squeeze?! Let me rephrase that - GME short squeeze is about to make fucking history, 🌈🐻s are playing poker with us, hoping we drop our shares before they close their positions.\\n\\nBut guess what?? This is a game that favors us! When you short, the maximum potential gain is 100% and **maximum potential loss is fucking infinity** ! They lost the game, are holding a pair of nothings and we got a freaking royal flush!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  1   \n",
